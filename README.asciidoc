Fossilise

__poor man's collaborative editing in vim__

Fossilise uses the http://www.fossil-scm.org/[Fossil] version control
system to synchronise changes between editors.

To test this you need to `:source fossilise.vim` and then run
`:Fossilise` in each of the editor sessions.

.Synchronising changes across multiple editors:

* make changes to this file here and save
* move your cursor in the clone and it will sync with this file
* make changes there and save; move your cursor here to see them

This is very much just an experiment at this stage. It will probably
never be anything more than that. The updates are woefully slow.
Interesting to play with for a bit though.
